            	<p>The course is made up of seven stages that will take you from coast to coast, brewtap to brewtap across England.</p>
                <p>Each stage can be completed in a single day by anyone who is fit and healthy, whether you're setting out to get a new stage record, a personal best, or just a long, relaxing walk.</p>
                <p>The shortest stage is 30.40km between Manchester and Warrington, and the longest (and also the hilliest) is 43.6km between York and Leeds, which should take no more than about eight hours - more if you stop for lunch along the way.</p>
                <p>Don't forget, this isn't an organised race day, so there are no road closures, no marshals and no water and fuel stations. But there's also no start time, no entry fee and no pressure!</p>
                <p>All start and end points (except one) are at brewery taps and make for great places to refresh yourself after your achievement.</p>
                <p>We've provided suggested routes, including start and finish points, but you don't have to use these if you don't want. Feel free to choose your own routes; just make sure that if you have a different start or end, you use those locations if you run an adjacent stage.</p>
                <p>Don't forget to track your runs and walks, and to send us a link to your record (ideally Strava etc) so that we can add you to the finishers' boards!</p>
