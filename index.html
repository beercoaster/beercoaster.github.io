			<h3>An open ended personal challenge, that will really challenge you.</h3>
            <p>Beer Coaster consists of seven stages varying in distance between 34 and 42 kilometres that will take you coast to coast, brewtap to brewtap.</p>
            <p>It can be done whichever direction you want, when you want. Whether you want to dip in and do a stage a year, or a month, or set out to do them all back to back!</p>
            <p>There's no hard and fast rules, there's no fixed courses or routes, or even start and end places. Although we do have ones we recommend.</p>
            <p>All we ask is that you take care, that you keep away from main roads, that you don't overstretch yourself, and that you have fun!</p>
            <p>It's a perfect plan/opportunity for fundraising, whether you run or stroll it. It's possible to complete any of the stages as long as you're fit, healthy, and dedicated.</p>
