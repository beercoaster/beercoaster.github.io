			<h3>FAQs</h3>
            <p>There's probably a lot of questions as this isn't your normal event, so let's see if we can answer them.</p>
            <h3>Will there be road closures?</h3>
            <p>Nope, this isn't an organised event on a fixed day. Because you're able to drop in and out, and do the stages when you want it would be prohibatively expensive to close the roads every day anyone wanted to give it a go.</p>
            <p>Because the roads won't be closed, you'll need to make sure to take care of the traffic. We've worked out routes for each stage that stay clear of busy roads and have footpaths for almost all of the way.</p>
            <h3>Will there be marshals?</h3>
            <p>Nope. Same reasons as no road closures, and as such you'll need to make sure that you know where you're going. Make sure to learn the route before hand and take along a map of some kind, and if it's a digtal map such as on your phone make sure to take a spare battery pack along.</p>
            <h3>Will there be water or food stations?</h3>
            <p>You can proobably guess the answer by now. You'll need to take along with you any water and food that you'll need, or maybe check out some pubs and shops along the way.</p>
            <h3>How much does it cost to enter?</h3>
			<p>It doesn't. It's free.</p>
            <p>Beer Coaster is (currently) a fun thing to do whenever you want to, and as such we don't incur any organising costs. In fact the only costs we have are running this website, and the only work we have to do is entering people's times into it. Which we're happy to do. Although if someone did want to give us some money to buy a pint we'll happily take it.</p>
            <p>If Beer Coaster does become popular, then this might all have to change, but we think we've future-proofed it enough for now.</p>
            <p>We also might in the future put on an organised race with chip timing, marshals, etc, and that would cost some money, but that's for future us to worry about.</p>
            <h3>How do I enter?</h3>
            <p>Simply go out, do a stage, and email us a link to a record of it. We prefer Strava as we understand how that works.</p>
            <p>We'll then check your run and enter it into the tables. If there's any queries about it, we may contact you to check. If you don't want us to share the link to your record, make sure to let us know and we'll leave it off.</p>
